    <p class="info">
      he French version of the kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant)
      shape and has become a universally identifiable shape across the world.
      The earliest known recipe for the present-day croissant appears in 1905,
      although the name croissant appears among the "fantasy or luxury breads"
      in 1853.
